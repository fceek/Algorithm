            <p><span>I</span> have learned the very basic knowledge about HTML and CSS till now. Using them I can create simple web pages with different layouts, modify the pages with styles. The difficult part I have found about this unit is solving various strange style errors. Since HTML and CSS are not very strict, errors can be ignored easily. It is a challege to find out and deal with problems.</p>

            <p><span>T</span>o be honest, I have done dozens of web design work before. But in most of the cases, I focused on the graphic and interface design, not the code. This unit helps me systematically went through the coding part so that I can handle with more complicated work in the future.</p>

            <p><span>I</span>n this unit, I was taught about concepts of object oriented programming: class and object, different kinds of methods, rules like encapsulation and polymorphism. Although those concepts are just of  beginner's level, they can provide a steady foundation for the study in year 1 and 2. Beside the OOP concepts, I learned about JAVA programming language as well.</p>

            <p><span>O</span>OP is the title of my essay of AESF class in the last semester, but I was not so clear about OOP even if I finished the essay. And my previous experiences of programming were almost all about algorithms, this is the first time I got to know about software engineering and constructing. I feel very interested and will try to get a good grade.</p>
