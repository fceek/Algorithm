            <p><span>I</span> have learned many numerical, algebraic, graphical and logical concepts. Together with how to solve problems with the help of these concepts. For example, manipulating numbers in different bases, dealing with propositional logic and traveling salesman problem. I regard this unit as a complete review of math knowledge I have gained before, so that I can get myself adapted to undergraduate study at Sussex.</p>

            <p><span>F</span>rankly speaking, knowledge introduced in this unit was mostly taught in Chinese high schools. But the math units here in the UK are much more specific and profound in certain subjects. That means this unit can offer me some directions on what aspects I need to research in order to perform better in following courses.</p>

            <p><span>I</span>n this unit, I managed to get through a full process of writing an essay: from barely a title to an outline and to a 1100-words essay. During this process I have got to know how to search for and evaluate data, give a presentation and attend discussions. English is one of the most important skill for university study, so I spent much time on this unit. Time and efforts spent would pay back in the future I think.</p>
